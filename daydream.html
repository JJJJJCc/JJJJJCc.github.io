             <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Can a game help people maintain mental health and wellness during Covid |<a href="https://jjjjjcc.github.io/ChiPlay2020_dayDream.pdf" target="_blank" download> paper</a></h2>
        </br>
        <p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter;"> 
           Many people all over the world still suffer from the stress induced by quarantine and social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak, and it is a topic of significance to manage negative feelings and emotions when considering mental health and wellness. Our questions are: "Can a game help people maintain mental health and wellness in such a situation?" and "Will virtual escape from isolation in the game help people feel better in reality?" Therefore, with the design concept of a "healing game", we developed Daydream, a game that combines puzzles and interactive music-making experiences with the design concept of a "healing game" to help players slow down, relax, and imagine. In Daydream, players collect magic objects that can retrieve the main character's memories and unfold her imagination, allowing players to enter a musical adventure. While this research project is still in the early stage, we conducted a preliminary user study and the feedback from the participant were generally positive to our design concept and game design. We believe such a design concept of a 'healing game' would be promising as an interesting research topic in serious games.

          <br>
           
           <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">This is a surreal adventure that starts from a normal quarantine day when Jessie has to work from home but desires to go out. Room's furnishings are hidden portals to magical worlds. If Jessie lets her imagination wander she will experience an unforgettable road trip, discover an enchanted starry night, and a digital city in need of a problem solver. Take a break from your hard days and follow Jessie‚Äôs daydreaming for a while.<br></br>
            In contrast to games that deliver "hard fun" by providing players with a sense of control and task achievement, "healing games" exist for the sake of calm, relaxation, and de-stressing. While these healing games have diverse game concepts and designs, it seems that there can be found some common features, such as healing music/sound, ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù experience, and fantasy world adventure. So we included these features into the game design.

<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Travel Through Retro Belongings</h2><br>
<h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">Travel through portals seems common in games, such as in Portal, The Lab, and Bridge Constructor Portal. Whereas portals are often a transparent mirror with sci-fi features, Daydream uses retro-style objects (i.e., a cassette tape, MP3 player, headset, disk, and light bulb). With the intention of reminding players of the past, using the retro-style objects could help reduce stress regarding the uncertain future due to the Covid19 pandemic. Many people are experiencing job hunting rejections, health-related fears, and uncertainty-induced stress. Under the current situation, retrospective nostalgia may lead to reflection on happy memories and feelings from the past

      <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Interactive Music Playing</h2><br>
      <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">Music is generally considered beneficial to easing one‚Äôs mind, and it plays a significant role in the design of healing games, as described in the previous section. Furthermore, the combination of interactive music experiences and game elements can provide a way for players to pursue optimal feelings. Therefore, we integrated an interactive music-playing experience to help players relax and engage. Players are instructed to accompany the vocals of the main character, Jessie. Since the game provides a certain degree of flexibility in playing the virtual piano, players with musical experience can creatively explore the accompaniment session, while players who don‚Äôt play instruments in real life can still participate in the accompaniment session by following the instructions.

        <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Visualization of Past Memories</h2><br>
           <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">Music has strong links with memories. For example, hearing a song from a previous playlist can take you back in time and retrieve the sights, sounds, and feelings of a specific event. Previous study showed that when people listen the songs in their music history archive, their episode memory associated with each song was retrieved. In this game, the author tries to use the concept of the connection between music and memory to build the travel destinations.
