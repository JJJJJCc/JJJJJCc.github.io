  <p>This is a surreal adventure that starts from a normal quarantine day when Jessie has to work from home but desires to go out. Room's furnishings are hidden portals to magical worlds. If Jessie lets her imagination wander she will experience an unforgettable road trip, discover an enchanted starry night, and a digital city in need of a problem solver. Take a break from your hard days and follow Jessie‚Äôs daydreaming for a while.<br>
   <h4>Healing Games</h4> 
  <p>In contrast to games that deliver "hard fun" by providing players
with a sense of control and task achievement, "healing games" exist
for the sake of calm, relaxation, and de-stressing. While these healing games have diverse game concepts and designs, it seems that there can be found some common features,
such as healing music/sound, ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù experience, and fantasy
world adventure. So we included these features into the game design.</p>
   <h4>Travel Through Retro Belongings</h4> 
  <p>Travel through portals seems common in games, such as in Portal,
The Lab, and Bridge Constructor Portal. Whereas portals
are often a transparent mirror with sci-fi features, Daydream uses
retro-style objects (i.e., a cassette tape, MP3 player, headset, disk,
and light bulb). With the intention
of reminding players of the past, using the retro-style objects could
help reduce stress regarding the uncertain future due to the Covid19 pandemic. Many people are experiencing job hunting rejections,
health-related fears, and uncertainty-induced stress. Under the
current situation, retrospective nostalgia may lead to refle</p>
  <h4>Interactive Music Playing</h4> 
  <p>Music is generally considered beneficial to easing one‚Äôs mind, and it plays a significant role in the design of healing games,
as described in the previous section. Furthermore, the combination
of interactive music experiences and game elements can provide a
way for players to pursue optimal feelings. Therefore, we integrated
an interactive music-playing experience to help players relax and
engage. Players are instructed
to accompany the vocals of the main character, Jessie. Since the
game provides a certain degree of flexibility in playing the virtual
piano, players with musical experience can creatively explore the
accompaniment session, while players who don‚Äôt play instruments
in real life can still participate in the accompaniment session by
following the instructions.</p>
    <h4>Visualization of Past Memories</h4> 
  <p>Music has strong links with memories. For example, hearing
a song from a previous playlist can take you back in time and
retrieve the sights, sounds, and feelings of a specific event. Previous
study showed that when people listen the songs in their music
history archive, their episode memory associated with each song
was retrieved. In this game, the author tries to use the concept
of the connection between music and memory to build the travel
destinations. </p>
